Snake game in Java
The Snake game is a simple yet entertaining program that allows the user to control a snake and eat fruits to increase their score. The game can be divided into three main parts: the main menu, the game window, and the leaderboard.

The main menu provides options to start the game, view the leaderboard, enter the player's name, and exit. The game window includes the game area where the snake can be controlled and fruits need to be eaten. The leaderboard displays the names and scores of previous players.

I've divided the code into different classes such as BaseFrame for window management, Frame for the main menu, and GameWindow for the game window. Each class has various methods and fields for implementing functionalities and managing data.

For testing, I used JUnit4 to verify the correct functioning of basic methods. With the help of the UML diagram, the relationships between classes and the structure of the program are easily understandable.
